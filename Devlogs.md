**Devlog: Checkpoint 1 - Setting Up React Project with Tailwind CSS**

**Date: [12-Mar-2024]**

**Objective:**  
Set up a new React project with Tailwind CSS integration, create a Dockerfile, and set up a .gitignore file to ensure smooth development and deployment processes.

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Initialize React Project**: Used `npx create-react-app` command to create a new React project named `your-project-name`.

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Accessed the newly created project directory using the `cd` command.

3. **Install Tailwind CSS**: Used `npm install tailwindcss` command to install Tailwind CSS.

4. **Tailwind Configuration**: Generated a Tailwind configuration file using `npx tailwindcss init` command.

5. **PostCSS Configuration**: Created a `postcss.config.js` file and added Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer as plugins.

6. **Import Tailwind CSS**: Imported Tailwind CSS into the project's `src/index.css` file.

7. **Start Development Server**: Used `npm start` command to start the development server and verify the setup.

8. **Create .gitignore File**: Created a `.gitignore` file in the project root directory to specify files and directories to be ignored by Git.

9. **Add Commonly Ignored Files**: Included entries in the `.gitignore` file to ignore files like `node_modules/`, `.DS_Store`, and `build/`.

10. **Create Dockerfile**: Created a Dockerfile in the project root directory to define the environment for running the application in a Docker container.

11. **Define Base Image**: Specified the official Node.js Docker image as the base image in the Dockerfile.

12. **Set Up Working Directory**: Set up the working directory inside the container as `/usr/src/app`.

13. **Copy Package Files**: Copied `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files into the container.

14. **Install Dependencies**: Ran `npm install` inside the container to install project dependencies.

15. **Copy Application Code**: Copied the remaining application code into the container.

16. **Expose Port**: Added an `EXPOSE` directive in the Dockerfile to expose the port on which the React application runs.

17. **Start Application**: Specified the command to start the React application in the Dockerfile using `CMD ["npm", "start"]`.

**Next Steps:**

- Test the Docker build process and run the application inside a Docker container.
- Continue development of frontend features and styling using React and Tailwind CSS.
- Consider additional optimizations and configurations for deployment.

**Notes:**  
Ensure to commit changes to version control (e.g., Git) at appropriate checkpoints to maintain project history and facilitate collaboration.
